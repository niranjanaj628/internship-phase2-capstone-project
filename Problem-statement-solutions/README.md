Problem Statements

#### Task- 1:
1. **Data Cleaning and Augmentation:**
   - **Problem Statement 1:** Identify and handle missing values using advanced imputation techniques. Correct anomalies by identifying outliers using statistical methods and domain knowledge. Standardize data formats and ensure consistency across the dataset. Augment the dataset by generating synthetic data using data augmentation techniques and collecting additional data from public sports databases. Integrate this data into a unified dataset.
  
2. **Position Analysis:**
   - **Problem Statement 2:** Analyze player positions to identify the highest and lowest number of players. Use statistical analysis to determine if the distribution of players across positions is significantly different from a uniform distribution. Create a plot showing the count of players for each position and a pie chart for distribution.

#### Task- 2:
1. **Data Ingestion Strategies:**
   - **Problem Statement 3:** Design and implement a data ingestion pipeline that supports incremental data loading. Optimize storage by using data partitioning and indexing strategies. Implement logging and monitoring to track the performance and reliability of the ingestion process. Utilize Python, pandas, and SQL for implementation.

2. **Pass Completion Rate vs. Assists:**
   - **Problem Statement 4:** Analyze the relationship between pass completion rate and assists. Create a scatter plot and identify outliers using advanced outlier detection methods like DBSCAN or Isolation Forest. Plot a line of best fit and use regression analysis to model the relationship. Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics.
 
#### Task- 3:
1. **Advanced Data Transformations:**
   - **Problem Statement 5:** Perform complex transformations on the dataset, including feature engineering to create new meaningful features. Implement additional strategies for data optimization, such as data normalization and dimensionality reduction.
 
2. **Data Warehousing:**
   - **Problem Statement 6:** Design and implement a data warehouse schema using advanced SQL features like window functions and CTEs (Common Table Expressions). Store the transformed data efficiently and ensure it supports complex analytical queries. Implement data security and access control mechanisms.
 
#### Task- 4:
1. **Team Goals Analysis:**
   - **Problem Statement 7:** Identify the team with the highest number of goals. Create a horizontal bar plot and a stacked bar chart. Perform a time series analysis to understand trends in goal scoring over the season. Identify the top goal scorer in that team and analyze their performance metrics over time.
  
2. **Reporting and Visualization:**
   - **Problem Statement 8:** Develop interactive dashboards and visualizations using tools like Power BI, Tableau, or custom web applications using Dash or Streamlit. Create reports that provide insights into player performance, team strategies, and potential areas for improvement. Incorporate advanced analytics like clustering and predictive modeling to forecast future performance.
